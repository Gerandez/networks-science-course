# Practicum

## Software requirements

You will need:

* [Cytoscape 3.10](https://cytoscape.org/download.html)
* The [clustermaker2 plug-in](https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/clustermaker2) for Cytoscape
* Python 3.8 or higher.
   * You can use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) package manager.
* Several Python packages
   * [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
   * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
   * [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   * [scipy](https://scipy.org/)
* Jupyter Notebooks.
   * Follow [these instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

:warning: Please, if you run into problems installing this software, **ask in the course forum**. Please do not ask the practice instructors, they absolutely do not have the bandwidth for this.

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted with a computer.

There are eight practice sessions in this course. The first session's handout is a document, the remaining sessions have handouts that are Python notebooks. Download the notebooks, open them, and follow the instructions there (some instructions are in color and are not visible in the preview shown on the GitHub website). Each session starts with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

At the end of each handout there is a description of what you should deliver. Please ask in the course forum or to your practice instructor ("*profesor/a de pr√°cticas*") any questions you may have.

**Deadline**

You are expected to deliver your work within the deadline. Deadlines vary: some practices may be delivered several days after the practice sessions, other are expected to be delivered **at the end of the session**, i.e., you will have to complete them within the two hours.
