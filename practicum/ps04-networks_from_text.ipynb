    "The input material you will use is a file named `CovidLockdownCatalonia.json.gz` available in the [data/](data/) directory. This is a gzip-compressed file, which you can de-compress using the `gunzip` command. The file contain about 35,500 messages (\"tweets\") posted between March 13th, 2020, and March 14th, 2020, containing a hashtag or keyword related to COVID-19, and posted by a user declaring a location in Catalonia.\n",

This is a website that provides COVID-19 collections of tweets, however, they only provide the identifier of the tweet, known as a tweet-id. To recover the entire tweet, a process commonly known as *re-hydration* was used, which involves querying an API from Twitter, giving the tweet-id, and obtaining the tweet. This can be done with a little bit of programming or using a software such as [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc#dehydrate).\n",

    "For more learning and extra points, create a file `account-type.csv` containing the type of account of the top 50 accounts with the most mentions. You can use types \"journalist\", \"media\", \"politician\", \"government institution\", \"individual\", \"health-related\", etc. which you should categorize manually. Create a visualization of the **mentions** graph either including only these 50 accounts, or including more accounts but highlighting these top 50 with colors. Use broad categories as needed and **do not worry if there are some ambiguities in the categorization,** e.g., if you are not 100% sure on whether someone should be in one category or another; just do your best.\n",
