    "\n",
    "* To create a graph, you use either `networkx.Graph` or `networkx.DiGraph`, which return an undirected an directed graph respectively.\n",
    "* To add a node to a graph *g*, you use `g.add_node(u)`, where *u* is the name of the node.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have more control over the visualization of the graph, such as setting the figure size, removing the axis, using a particular layout algorithm, or changing the node size or color:\n",
