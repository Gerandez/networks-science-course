# Network Science Course (old: 2022 edition)

Instructor: [Carlos Castillo](https://chato.cl/)

These are materials for an undergraduate course on **Network Science**, and include two-hour lectures and two-hour practice sessions every week. They were developed for second year students of the bachelor degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

* *"It is a very interesting subject, and it seems very useful for data scientists." -- a student's evaluation from the 2021 edition*
* *"This has been by far my favorite subject in the degree and the one in which I've learned the most." -- a student's evaluation from the 2020 edition.*
* *"The most interesting subject so far ... the volume of work is quite a lot, but the topics are engaging." -- a student's evaluation from the 2019 edition.*
* *"By far, the most interesting and fun subject of the trimester!" -- a student's evaluation from the 2018 edition.*
