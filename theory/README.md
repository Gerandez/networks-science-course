# List of theory topics

:construction: These materials should not be considered final until the end of the course. Materials from previous editions can be found in other branches of the repository for the course.

There are 11 theory sessions of 2 hours each. They will all take place face-to-face. Please bring your laptop.

**Before each class, there are short videos you should watch.** They are up to 20 minutes in total, and watching them requires some preparation/scheduling on your part. Please set aside time in your schedule to watch these videos before coming to class, ideally on the day before.

**During class,** I will present the contents using slides and we will do together some exercises using Nearpod or Google Spreadsheets. Please avoid distractions: place your phone in airplane mode, close all other windows in your computer, and try to stay focused. We will pause frequently during the session to help you regain focus. In one of the sessions, a *midterm exam* will be taken, and at the end of the course, a *final exam* will be taken. The exam questions are based exclusively on the materials shown or discussed in the lectures during class.

**After each session, there is some reading for you to do.** These readings will be much easier after you have attended each lecture, will bring depth to what you learn in class, and will help you remember these contents better. Think of these readings as a form of continuous studying that will save you time and effort when preparing for the exams.

# Notes

These slides are made with LibreOffice and the [TexMaths](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/texmaths-1) extension, which allows to easily enter and edit LaTeX equations that are embedded as images in the slides.

Note that the source files include some solutions, while the PDF files do not include them. Use this while studying: do not look at the solutions until you have tried to solve the problem yourself.
